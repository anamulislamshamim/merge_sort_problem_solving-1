# You are given an array of n positive integers. The next line will contain an integer k. You need to tell whether there exists more than one occurrence of k in that array or not. If there exists more than one occurrence of k print YES, Otherwise print NO.
# See the sample input-output for more clarification.
# Note - The given array will be sorted in increasing order. And it is guaranteed that at least one occurrence of k will exist. Do this inside the merge sort. That means O(nlogn);
